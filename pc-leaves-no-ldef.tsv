GO:0035101	FACT complex	An abundant nuclear complex, which was originally identified in mammalian systems as a factor required for transcription elongation on chromatin templates. The FACT complex has been shown to destablilize the interaction between the H2A/H2B dimer and the H3/H4 tetramer of the nucleosome, thus reorganizing the structure of the nucleosome. In this way, the FACT complex may play a role in DNA replication and other processes that traverse the chromatin, as well as in transcription elongation. FACT is composed of two proteins that are evolutionarily conserved in all eukaryotes and homologous to mammalian Spt16 and SSRP1. In metazoans, the SSRP1 homolog contains an HMG domain; however in fungi and protists, it does not. For example, in S. cerevisiae the Pob3 protein is homologous to SSRP1, but lacks the HMG chromatin binding domain. Instead, the yFACT complex of Spt16p and Pob3p, binds to nucleosomes where multiple copies of the HMG-domain containing protein Nhp6p have already bound, but Nhp6p does not form a stable complex with the Spt16p/Pob3p heterodimer.

HCN4 is the dominant form of HCN expressed in the heart, together with HCN2. HCN4 expression is particularly high in the sinoatrial node, where impulses initiate and propagate throughout the heart. There is pharmacologic and genetic evidence that the HNC4 channel complex plays a role in cardiac pacemaking and automaticity, by contributing to the native pacemaker current of the heart (If). Mutations in the C-terminus containing the C-linker and CNBD domain, which affect the expression or function of the HCN4 channel are known to cause arrhythmias or bradycardia.

GO:1990759	HCN2 channel complex	HCN2 is a member of the hyperpolarization-activated ion channel family, which shows selectivity for potassium over sodium ions. Channel gating is facilitated by cAMP binding to the cyclic nucleotide binding domain. HCN2 is the dominant form of HCN expressed in the heart, together with HCN4 (O70507). HCN2 shows significant expression in various regions of the heart, especially the ventricles. There is pharmacological and genetic evidence that HCN channels play a role in cardiac pacemaking and automaticity, by contributing to the native pacemaker current of the heart (If).
